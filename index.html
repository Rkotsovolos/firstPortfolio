        <div> <!-- Main story behind how I got involved in coding -->
          <p>Coming from a background of loving technology ever since I was little, I found myself wanting to do more than just understand components in a machine, but how a machine works. What and how is it that the world is able to connect and communicate so effortlessly. This is around high school graduation of 2009, yet I didn't know where to start. Time flew by and my curiosity was put on hold by... life. Time disenegrated quicker as I got older and that saying, "Time flies as you age" became more relevant. My cousin who is a developer was talking at the dinner table about what he does and how it works and I couldn't have been more confused at the time, but also intrigued. I had to get my feet wet in this industry, for this is what I was looking for. Now I have been coding and learning to code for a few months and my curiousity has blossomed and I can't wait to make a career out of this.</p>
